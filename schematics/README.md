# Schematics

This folder contains circuit diagrams, wiring schematics, and hardware connection diagrams for the ESP32 Home Automation project.

## Contents

Add your schematic images and diagrams here. Recommended file types:
- `.png` - For high-quality screenshots and diagrams
- `.jpg`/`.jpeg` - For photographs of physical setups
- `.svg` - For vector-based diagrams (preferred for scalability)
- `.pdf` - For detailed circuit documentation

## Suggested Schematics to Include

- **ESP32 Pinout Diagram**: Showing which GPIO pins are used for relays, LEDs, sensors, etc.
- **Relay Module Wiring**: Connection diagram between ESP32 and relay modules
- **Power Supply Schematic**: How to safely power the ESP32 and relay modules
- **Complete System Diagram**: Overall system architecture and connections
- **PCB Layout** (if applicable): Custom PCB designs for the project

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names for your files:
- `esp32-pinout.png`
- `relay-wiring-diagram.png`
- `power-supply-schematic.png`
- `complete-circuit.png`

## Contributing

When adding schematics:
1. Ensure diagrams are clear and readable
2. Include labels for all components and connections
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Add descriptions in this README if needed
5. Compress large image files to keep repository size manageable

## Tools for Creating Schematics

Recommended tools:
- **Fritzing** - Easy-to-use for breadboard and PCB layouts
- **EasyEDA** - Free online circuit design tool
- **KiCad** - Professional open-source PCB design software
- **draw.io** - For system architecture diagrams
- **CircuitMaker** - Free PCB design tool

## License

All schematics in this folder follow the same license as the main project.
